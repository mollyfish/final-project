Welcome to Song Writer, where anyone can create a melodious jam.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
* Create an account <strong>or</strong> login to ensure your songs get saved to the global catalog.
* If you want to just experiment, simply click "Create a Song" to get started fast.
* If you'd rather just check out the global catalog and listen to soothing tunes, click "View Song Catalog" to proceed.

<h2>Composing a Song</h2>
* When creating a song, the top nav lists all of the possible key signatures, and ultimately the path your song will take once you begin to select chords.
* To build the basic 4 chord song structure, grab the blue chord images by clicking and dragging them into the chosen chords field below. As you drag, notice the "Allowed Keys" navigation begins to filter down. This will also filter your remaining chord choices to ensure you stick to a contemporary key signature format.
